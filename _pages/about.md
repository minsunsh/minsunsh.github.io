Hello, my name is Minsun Shim. I am a first-year Ph.D. student at UC Irvine, advised by [Prof. Zhou Li](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/zhouli/). My current research focus is **LLM Security** and **Network Security**.

Before joining UC Irvine, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at University of Southern California (USC), and was part of the [STEEL lab](https://steel.isi.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jelena Mirkovic](https://www.isi.edu/people-mirkovic/).
I also received my Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at Seoul Women's University (SWU).
